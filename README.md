# Getting started

On your linux box, just execute the following command:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/centriascolocation/linux-system-info/master/system-info.sh | sudo bash -
```

*Note*: sudo is required! Also make sure, you have all the little reporting tools installed. Otherwise, nothing breaks, but: no information can be retrieved.
